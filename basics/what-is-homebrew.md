# ‚ùî what is homebrew?

homebrew refers to software in general that was not authorized by the hardware producer to run in the first place - in this case, nintendo.

however, homebrew can unlock the potential of your wii. these include fanmade games, useful apps and tools to customize your wii.

homebrew is available for the wii, but it's generally developed for all consoles by fans. there's different guides for that, for example, if you want to homebrew a 3DS this isn't the right place. go and read the guide for that.
